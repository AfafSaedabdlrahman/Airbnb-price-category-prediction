Describing a machine learning or deep learning model for predicting two outputs, namely the type and price of an Airbnb listing based on its description (textual data) and image. The model seems to be designed with various layers such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and bidirectional layers for processing textual data. Additionally, regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization are applied to the text, and for image data, techniques such as resizing and normalization are used.
