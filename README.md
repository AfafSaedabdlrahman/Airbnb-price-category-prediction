Describing a machine learning or deep learning model for predicting two outputs, namely the type and price of an Airbnb listing based on its description (textual data) and image. The model seems to be designed with various layers such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and bidirectional layers for processing textual data. Additionally, regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization are applied to the text, and for image data, techniques such as resizing and normalization are used.Let's break down the components mentioned:

Textual Data Processing:

LSTM and GRU Layers: These are types of recurrent neural network (RNN) layers designed to capture sequential patterns in data, which is useful for processing text.
Bidirectional Layers: These layers process the input data in both forward and backward directions, capturing information from both past and future contexts.
Regularization Techniques for Text:

Dropout: This technique involves randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting.
Batch Normalization: This normalizes the input of a layer, aiming to reduce internal covariate shift and improve training stability.
Image Data Processing:

Resizing: This involves adjusting the size of the input images to a standard size, which is often necessary for consistency in neural network models.
Normalization: Normalizing pixel values to a standard range (e.g., between 0 and 1) helps in stabilizing the training process.
Output:

The model is designed to predict two outputs: the type and price of the Airbnb listing.
It  is  multi-output model where both textual and image data contribute to predicting the type and price of the listing. The use of diverse layers and regularization techniques indicates an effort to build a robust and generalizable model that can handle the complexity of both text and image inputs.
