# Airbnb-price-category-prediction
Is the model able to predict the listing price of the apartment based on its
description and image on AirBnB? The dataset has two features as input (a summary and an image) and two outputs
(type and price) and has been quantifed succes using trying  different layers like LSTM, GRU, and bidirectional layers, as well as using diï¬€erent
tools of regularisation  for the text(e.g,dropout, batch normalisation).  for the image(e.g,Resizing, Normalization).
